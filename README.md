# HtmlPuzzles

**HtmlPuzzles** is an experimental Go library for creating custom HTML components with a custom render pipeline. This project was created for educational purposes to study HTML parsing, DSL creation, and architectural patterns.

##  Main Idea

The library allows you to:
- Create custom HTML tags with custom logic
- Implement your own components (loops, conditions, variables, etc.)
- Manage execution context with layer support
- Parse and render HTML with custom tags

##  Installation

```bash
go get github.com/DilemaFixer/HtmlPuzzles
```
